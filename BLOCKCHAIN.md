BLOCKCHAIN:
  Blockchain is a continously growing list of records, called block. Which are linked and secured using cryptography.
BLOCK consit of:
    1. Data : "HEllo world"
    2. Prev.Hash : 034DFA327
    3. Hash : 4D329021 ( Hash is the fingerprint of the data )
    
1st BLOCK | GENESIS BLOCK :
     It is a first block and its a origin of the chain.
     It never ever chnaged.
          1.  data 
          2. Doest has a previous Hash
          3. own hash : 23DT432 
          
2nd BLOCK:
          1.  data 
          2. previous hash :  23DT432
          3. own hash : 12YK349 
    
3rd BLOCK:
          1.  data 
          2. previous hash :  12YK349
          3. own hash : 2YK34
